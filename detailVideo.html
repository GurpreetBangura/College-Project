                              <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause a range of illnesses in humans, from the common cold to SARS. Viruses of this family also cause a number of animal diseases.</p>
                              <pre><strong style="font-size: 16px;">Pandemic Coronavirus (COVID-19)</strong></pre>
                              <p>On December 31, 2019 the WHO China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The outbreak began in a seafood and poultry market in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China. Like SARS and MERS-CoV, the newly detected coronavirus has a zoonotic source, however, human to human transmission has been confirmed. On March 11, 2020 the WHO declared COVID-19 viral disease a pandemic.</p>
                              <pre><strong style="font-size: 16px;">Surveillance for COVID-19</strong></pre>
                              <p>Infection Provincial/Territorial public health authorities should report confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 nationally to the Public Health Agency of Canada within 24 hours of their own notification.<BR/></p>

                              <p style="border-left: 8px solid #09d9d4; padding-left: 12px; border-radius: 6px;">Prior to any patient interaction, all healthcare workers (HCWs) have a responsibility to assess the infectious risk posed to themselves and to other patients, visitors, and HCWs. This risk assessment is based on professional judgment about the clinical situation and up-to-date information on how the specific healthcare organization has designed and implemented engineering and administrative controls, along with the availability and use of personal protective equipment (PPE).</p>
                              <p> Recommendations for infection prevention and control measures for patients presenting with suspected or confirmed infection or co-infection with COVID-19 in acute care settings include:</p>
                              <ol>
                                 <li>Routine Practices: For all patients, at all times, in all healthcare settings including when performing a point-of-care risk assessment, and adherence to respiratory hygiene and hand hygiene.</li>
                                 Contact and Droplet Precautions (should be implemented empirically): 
                                 <li>Wear gloves and a long-sleeved gown upon entering the patient's room, cubicle or designated bedspace.</li>
                                 <li>Wear facial protection (surgical or procedure mask and eye protection, or face shield, or mask with visor attachment) when within two metres of a patient suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection.</li>
                                 <li> Airborne Precautions: When performing aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs). A respirator and face/eye protection should be used by all HCWs present in a room where an AGMP is being performed on a patient suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. Whenever possible, AGMPs should be performed in an airborne infection isolation room</li>
                                 .
                              </ol>
                              <p>As information becomes available, these recommendations will be re-evaluated and updated as needed.</p>
